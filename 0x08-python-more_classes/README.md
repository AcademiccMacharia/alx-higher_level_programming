### Python - More Classes and Objects

-----------


In this directory I delve more into classes and objects. I have also gone into the class and instance attributes. Class attributes are the variables defined directly in the class that are shared by all objects of the class. Instance attributes are attributes or properties attached to an instance of a class. Instance attributes are defined in the constructor.

The table below contains files in this directory as well as their descriptions.

| **Files** | **Description** |
| ------- | ---------- |
| `0-rectangle.py` | Empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle |
| `1-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle |
| `2-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle and gets its area and perimeter |
| `3-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by string representation |
| `4-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle's properties |
