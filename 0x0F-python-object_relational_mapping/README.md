# Python - Object Relational Mapping(ORM)

This project demonstrates how to use Python's ORM libraries to interact with a relational database. By using ORM libraries such as SQLAlchemy, you can write Python code that is more intuitive and easier to maintain than raw SQL queries. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out.
