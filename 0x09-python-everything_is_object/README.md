### Python - Everything is object

------

In this project, I delve into objects in Python. The files in this directory cover objects and values. In Python, given variable `a` and `b` they can refer to different things with same value or to the same thing. These things are the ones referred to as `objects`. We can test whether two names have the same value using `==`

			a == b

We can test whether two names refer to the same object using the `is` operator.

			a is b

The files in this directory answer the questions presented in the ALX projects thus their format will be `.txt` files.
