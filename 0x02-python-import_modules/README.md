### Python - import & modules

-------

In this directory, I delve into the python imports and modules as well as using command line arguments with Python programs. 

A module is simply a file containing python code, it may contain functions, classes, e.t.c. A module can be saved inside `packages`(a way of structuring python's module namespace by using **dotted module names**) and used for different programs. A module is created by writing a python code in a file, with a `.py` extension. It can be called using the `import` keyword.

Example of ðŸ“ž a module:

The table below contains the files found in this directory as well as their descriptions

| **Files** | **Description** |
| -------- | -------- |
| `0-add.py` | Program that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3` |
| `1-calculation.py` | Program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, does some Maths, and prints the result |
| `2-args.py` | Program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments |
| `3-infinite_add.py` | Program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments |
| `4-hidden_discovery.py` | Program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc` |
| `5-variable_load.py` | Program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value |
| `100-my_calculator.py` | Program that imports all functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and handles basic operations |
| `101-easy_print.py` | Program that prints `#pythoniscool`, followed by a new line, in the standard output |
| `102-magic_calculation.py` | Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b):` that does exactly the same as a Python bytecode |
