### Python - Data Structures:Lists, Tuples

-----------

In this directory, I delve into python lists and tuples. List is a collection of arbitary objects and are mutable. Tuples are identical to lists in all respects, except for the following properties:

	1. Tuples are immutable
	2. Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([])

Differences between tuples and lists:
