### PYTHON - if/else, loops, functions

---------

In this directory, I delve into the python `if`, `if ... else` statements. Also how to affect the values to variables and how to use the `while` and `for` loops. 

Also, in this directory I look at the Python `traceback`. This is a report containining the function calls made in your code ata a specific point i.e when you get an error it is recommended that you should trace it backward.

That being said:

		if information above == Interesting:
			print("Look at the table below")
		else:
			print("Still look at the table below")
