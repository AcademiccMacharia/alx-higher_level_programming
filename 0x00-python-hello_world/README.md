## Python - Hello, World

Python is a high level programming language which there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.

In this directory, we are delving into `Python_scripts` which is files containing the commands to be executed like a program. Python interactive shell or the respective command line is used to execute the script, to perform a specific task.

Also the `print()` function in Python will be looked at, as well as python 3's f-Strings. F-strings are the newest and most improved way to format strings in Python. Also called “formatted string literals,” f-strings are string literals that have an f at the beginning and curly braces containing expressions that will be replaced with their values. The expressions are evaluated at runtime and then formatted using the __format__ protocol. 
Do you love f-strings yet? I hope that once you go through these files, you’ll answer `>>> F"Yes!"`.
