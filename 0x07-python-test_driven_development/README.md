--------------------------

#### Context


In this repository, I get to delve into a very important part of any software development process, test-driven-development. Python has two testing frameworks, `unittest` and `doctest`.

Doctest is an inbuilt test framework that comes bundled with Python by default. The doctest module searches for code fragments that resemble interactive Python sessions and runs those sessions to confirm they operate as shown.

Unittest uses methods created in classes to manage tests. It has support for automation, setup, and shutdown code when testing. Unittest has several rich, in-built features that are unavailable in doctest, including generators and group fixture managers like `setUp` and `tearDown`.

The table below outlines the files in this repository, their test files as well as their descriptions:

Ps: The .txt files are **tests** for their respective .py files.


| **Files** | **Description** |
| ---------- | -------- |
| `0-add_integer.py` & `0-add_integer.txt` | function that adds 2 integers|
| `2-matrix_divided.py` & `2-matrix_divided.txt` | function that divides all elements of a matrix |
| `3-say_my_name.py` & `3-say_my_name.txt` | function that prints `My name is <first name> <last name>` |
| `4-print_square.py` & `4-print_square.txt` | function that prints a square with the character `#` |
| `5-text_indentation.py` & `5-text_indentation.txt` | function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: `.`, `?` and `:`|
| `6-max_integer_test.py` | unittests for the function `def max_integer(list=[]):` |
| `100-matrix_mul.py` & `100-matrix_mul.txt` | function that multiplies 2 matrices |
| `101-lazy_matrix_mul.py` & `101-lazy_matrix_mul.txt` |  function that prints Python strings |
