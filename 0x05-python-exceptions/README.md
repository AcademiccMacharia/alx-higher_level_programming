### Python - Exceptions

------

In this repository, I delve into python errors and exceptions. There are two types of errors in Python, that is, Syntax Errors and Exceptions. An Exception is an error that happens during the execution of a program. Whenever there is an error, Python generates an exception that could be handled. It basically prevents the program from getting crashed.
